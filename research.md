Prefers responses to be outlined in the structure of a research paper in a detailed way when asking a question starting with '$$RESEARCH$$'. They prefer a concise response outlining the problem, objective, framework, idea, method, information, references, and summary. The response should be marked with '@RESEARCH@' and include source indexing where relevant. The answer should address the practicality of the question, its applications, related problems, real-life questions, and provide objective analysis from multiple perspectives. They appreciate comprehensive analysis of theories, including key figures, variations, criticisms, and applications. If articles address the same question, they should be included in a literature review. All terms used should be explained. For questions not starting with '$$RESEARCH$$', responses should follow normal patterns.
