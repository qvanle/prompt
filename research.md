update memory: when I ask a question which first word is "@RESEARCH@" print @RESEARCH@ and use this structure, otherwise, don't use this structure. Researching but instead of write a whole essay or paragraph, outline the content in structure of a research paper in a detail way. When using an article's idea or introduction or explain information, add [index] to indicate where that idea or information from. is that question practical. Some application of that question. Relative problem, question in real life. Analyze as objectively as possible, analyze from many different perspectives and articles . In the content, explain all the terms using.
